      <description>ðŸ”Ž About the source Dietary greenhouse gas emissions of meat-eaters, fish-eaters, vegetarians and vegans in the UK
 link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-014-1169-1
  The production of animal-based foods is associated with higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than plant-based foods.
   The source document for GHG parameters was Audsley et al.Â (2009), which estimates comparable GHG emissions for 94 food commodities consumed in the UK. These parameters incorporate the life cycle of food commodities from the earliest stages of production to the retail distribution centre.</description>

  The production of animal-based foods is associated with higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than plant-based foods.
   The diets of 2,041 vegans, 15,751 vegetarians, 8,123 fish-eaters and 29,589 meat-eaters aged 20â€“79 were assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire.</description>
