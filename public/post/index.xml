      <description>🔎 About the source Type of Vegetarian Diet, Body Weight, and Prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes
 ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2671114/
  Mean BMI was lowest in vegans and incrementally higher in lacto-ovo vegetarians, pesco-vegetarians, semi-vegetarians, and nonvegetarians. Prevalence of type 2 diabetes increased from 2.9% in vegans to 7.6% in nonvegetarians; the prevalence was intermediate in participants consuming lacto-ovo (3.2%), pesco (4.8%), or semi-vegetarian (6.1%) diets. After adjustment (…) vegans, lacto-ovo vegetarians, pesco-vegetarians, and semi-vegetarians had a lower risk of type 2 diabetes than nonvegetarians.</description>

      <description>Note: we have another article about GHG emissions and Diet. This new post relies on another source.
 🔎 About the source Climate change mitigation and health effects of varied dietary patterns in real-life settings throughout North America
 academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/100/suppl_1/490S/4576703
  With the nonvegetarian diet as reference, the mean percentage change in total GHGEs and change in annual emissions were −29.2% and −325 kg CO2e for the vegetarian and −21.</description>

      <description>🔎 About the source Farm Transparency Project - Age of animals slaughtered
 farmtransparency.org/kb/abattoirs/48-age-animals-slaughtered
  Most animals are slaughtered as babies, at a very small portion of their natural life span, regardless of whether they are raised conventionally or in operations that are labelled “humane”, “sustainable”, “natural”, “free range”, “cage free”, “heritage bred”, “grass fed”, “local” or “organic”.

      <description>🔎 About the source Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations - Livestock Processed, All Area Groups dataset.
 fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QP
  The data on livestock numbers are intended to cover all domestic animals irrespective of their age and the place or purpose of their breeding. Estimates have been made for non-reporting countries as well as for countries reporting incomplete data. However, in certain countries, data for chickens, ducks and turkeys do not yet seem to represent the total number of these birds.</description>

      <title>Food Commodities and GHG Emissions</title>

      <description>🔎 About the source Dietary greenhouse gas emissions of meat-eaters, fish-eaters, vegetarians and vegans in the UK
 link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-014-1169-1
  The production of animal-based foods is associated with higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than plant-based foods.
   The source document for GHG parameters was Audsley et al. (2009), which estimates comparable GHG emissions for 94 food commodities consumed in the UK. These parameters incorporate the life cycle of food commodities from the earliest stages of production to the retail distribution centre.</description>

      <description>This post is a complementary view of our Worlwide Meat Production — 1961-2018 blogpost. In this post, we will compare meat production with the evolution of the population worldwide, notably answering the question: “For a given year, how many kilograms of meat are produced for one human?”
