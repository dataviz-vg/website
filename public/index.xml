      <description>About DataViz.vg wants to make data related to food and nutrition more available by providing easy to read visualizations of the data (data-visualization, or dataviz in short). All articles are related to the Vegetarian/Vegan lifestyle.
In each post, we will provide the source of the dataset, a link to it, a key quote (when it&amp;rsquo;s an article), and how the data were collected, if ever the information is available. The dataset used to build the visualization is also available under each dataviz.</description>
