      <description>🔎 About the source Farm Transparency Project - Age of animals slaughtered

      <description>🔎 About the source Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations - Livestock Processed, All Area Groups dataset.
 fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QP
  The data on livestock numbers are intended to cover all domestic animals irrespective of their age and the place or purpose of their breeding. Estimates have been made for non-reporting countries as well as for countries reporting incomplete data. However, in certain countries, data for chickens, ducks and turkeys do not yet seem to represent the total number of these birds.</description>
