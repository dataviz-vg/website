> Mean BMI was lowest in vegans and incrementally higher in lacto-ovo vegetarians, pesco-vegetarians, semi-vegetarians, and nonvegetarians. Prevalence of type 2 diabetes increased from 2.9% in vegans to 7.6% in nonvegetarians; the prevalence was intermediate in participants consuming lacto-ovo (3.2%), pesco (4.8%), or semi-vegetarian (6.1%) diets. After adjustment (...) vegans, lacto-ovo vegetarians, pesco-vegetarians, and semi-vegetarians had a lower risk of type 2 diabetes than nonvegetarians.

> The study population comprised 22,434 men and 38,469 women who participated in the Adventist Health Study-2 conducted in 2002â€“2006. We collected self-reported demographic, anthropometric, medical history, and lifestyle data from Seventh-Day Adventist church members across North America. The type of vegetarian diet was categorized based on a food-frequency questionnaire. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs using multivariate-adjusted logistic regression.
