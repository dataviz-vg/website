## About

DataViz.vg wants to make data related to food and nutrition more available by providing easy to read visualizations of the data (data-visualization, or dataviz in short). 
All articles are related to the Vegetarian/Vegan lifestyle. 

In each post, we will provide the source of the dataset, a link to it, a key quote (when it's an article), and how the data were collected, if ever the information is available. 
The dataset used to build the visualization is also available under each dataviz.

An online version of the code used to analyze and build the dataset is available on a link at the bottom of each article, so that if you want to know more about how the article was built, you're free to peek behind the curtains, and reproduce it yourself.
